The song wasn't intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend's fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line \"Hope I die before I get old.\" \"My Generation' was very much about trying to find a place in society,\" he told�Rolling Stone�in 1987. \"I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief.\" Instead, \"My Generation\" became the Who's ticket to legend � their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels � and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. \"My Generation\" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression � he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro's strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren't available. (He ended up playing the song on a Fender.)�Roger Daltrey's stuttering, howling performance, Townshend and Entwistle's R&B-inspired backing vocals, and the upward key changes created a vivid, mounting anxiety that climaxed with a studio re-creation of the Who's live gear-trashing finales, with Townshend spewing feedback all over Keith Moon's avalanche drumming. Four decades later, Townshend and Daltrey are all that remain of the original Who, and they still play \"My Generation\" at every show � now with the fire and wisdom of age.",

So he and�John Lennon�went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where � \"one on one, eyeball to eyeball,\" as Lennon put it � they wrote \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's�Chuck Berry�riffing to�George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps.

And it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of�Jimi Hendrix. For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record � and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the \"Hendrix chord.\") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called \"Purple Haze � Jesus Saves\"). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: \"Actin' funny, but I don't know why/'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.\" (Hendrix later said that he had written the lyrics after he'd had a dream in which he could walk underwater.) The Experience recorded \"Purple Haze\" across a series of sessions in January and February, 1967, experimenting with recording techniques such as the blitzed-out distortion on Hendrix's guitar � when the master tape was sent to their American record label, an enclosed note diligently pointed out that the distorted sound of the song was deliberate. In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed. \"Purple Haze\" � the opening track on the U.S. version of his debut LP,�Are You Experienced?�� captured the liberating rush of Day-Glo culture just in time for the Summer of Love.",

On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of \"Hound Dog\" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation � notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound.

John Lennon, the group's resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney's secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st � the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London.

Reid got the idea for the song when he overheard someone at a party tell a woman, \"You've gone a whiter shade of pale.\" The track was also the only one recorded by the initial lineup of Procol Harum, which started as a British band, the Paramounts, in 1963. A worldwide smash that sold more than 6 million copies and quickly found its way into wedding ceremonies (and, later, the Big Chill soundtrack), \"Pale\" helped kick-start the classical-rock boomlet that gave the world the Moody Blues.",
